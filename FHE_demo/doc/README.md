# ðŸ˜ƒ Getting Started

{% hint style="info" %}
This library (PhantomFHE) is developed and maintained for the research purpose, and the authors are not responsible for any potential issue in production.
{% endhint %}

## Welcome to PhantomFHE!

PhantomFHE is a CUDA-Accelerated Fully Homomorphic Encryption library. It is written in CUDA/C++ and provides Python bindings. It implements all operations of BFV, BGV, and CKKS on GPU (excluding bootstrapping by far).

## Why PhantomFHE?

Nowadays there are a variety of applications based on homomorphic encryption to ensure privacy, especially privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). But the main limitation of these applications is always the performance. PhantomFHE aims to acclerate FHE schemes using GPUs and improve practicality of HE-based applications.

## Features

* Native GPU acceleration (for NVIDIA GPUs)
* Support word-wise schemes including BGV, BFV, and CKKS (without bootstrapping)
* SOTA performance in most operations
* Easy to integrate with applications (PPML, etc.)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

#### Hardwares

* NVIDIA GPU
  * Server: V100, A100, etc.
  * Desktop: RTX 30/40 series, etc.
  * Embedded: AGX Xavier/Orin, etc.
* AMD64/AARCH64 CPU
* stable network for git operations

#### Softwares

* Operating system: Linux only (Debian-based, Arch-based, etc.)
* CUDA Toolkit $$\geq$$ 11.0 (recommended)
* CMake $$\geq$$ 3.20
* GCC  9.0 (recommended)
* Python $$\geq$$ 3.7 (required by pybind11)

### Get PhantomFHE

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/encryptorion-lab/phantom-fhe.git
```

Notice that you should also clone submodules. If you choose to download source zip, please make sure any CMake configuration related to submodules (nvbench, pybind11) must be turned off.

### Build PhantomFHE

Minimal just-work commands are listed below:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=native
cmake --build build -j
```

If the above commands don't work for you, or you want to build specific targets, please read [configuration.md](configuration.md "mention") for more details. For a fast check-in, we disabled test, bench, and Python binding options by default.

### Run PhantomFHE

Try examples by running:

```bash
./build/bin/example_context
```

## Roadmap

We are planning to support the following features in the future:

* [ ] support bit-wise schemes TFHE/FHEW
* [ ] support scheme switching between word-wise schemes and bit-wise schemes
* [ ] support bootstrapping for BFV/BGV/CKKS
